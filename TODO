grep TODO in package go files
-refactor code to make public key funcs to do hash so can write
  verify program perhaps through 'go test' of a given blkchain file.
-add go test code.
-add search key feature
-add dependency management of github.com external packages, e.g. gorilla/mux and phcurtis/fn.
-consider level logging
-add peer to peer feature
-reevaluate what level of -verblvl should dump conditional output messages/logging.
-evaluate if atomic vars that have a nexus might be handled as a group to avoid rare 
  disjointed-ness although the main reason for this possible concern is to provide 
  debug like monitoring via -expvar. 
- possible change destination of -blkfile (output)  
   from default blkchain.json to tmpout/blkchain.json but need to be 
   concerned with / versus \ in different environments.
