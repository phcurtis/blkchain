grep TODO in package go files
-refactor code to make public key funcs to do hash so can write
  verify program perhaps through 'go test' of a given blkchain file.
-add go test code.
-add search key feature
-add dependency management of github.com external packages, e.g. gorilla/mux and phcurtis/fn.
-consider level logging
-add peer to peer feature
-add flag to dump excodes with text; perhaps use map[exitcode(int)]string 
  where string includes: exitcode-number, gocodename and text, maybe AST in play here?
-add dump invocation time to output when -invdetails is set
-add flag and related code to enable an http api request to shutdown server (gracefully)
-reevaluate what level of -verblvl should dump conditional output messages/logging.
-evaluate if atomic vars that have a nexus might be handled as a group to avoid rare disjointed-ness although the main reason for this possible concern is to provide debug like monitoring via -expvar.
